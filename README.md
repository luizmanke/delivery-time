# Delivery Time Prediction

Delivery time prediction has long been a part of city logistics, but refining accuracy has recently become very important for services which deliver food on-demand.

These services and similar ones must receive an order and have it delivered within minutes to appease their users. In these situations a few minutes can make a big difference so it’s very important for customer satisfaction that the initial prediction is highly accurate and that any delays are communicated effectively.

In [this project](https://github.com/luizmanke/delivery-time/blob/master/main.ipynb), I’ll discuss my experience building a real-world delivery time prediction model. I'll get into technical topics of machine learning while focusing on the business knowledge required to create a well-functioning predictive model.
